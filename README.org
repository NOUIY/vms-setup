#+TITLE: Windows machine config

* About

This is a set of basic configuration files and scripts towards a basic safe dev environment when I must use Windows. I'd still go through a similar process under Mac OS or Linux.

I have tailored it to my basic needs, it doesn't necessarily reflect what I'm currently using.

This repo is meant for the initial machine setup within a corporate environment:
- Non-aggressive approaches (registry settings, deleting IE, etc.)
- Most machines are setup to go through a proxy server, etc.
- Machines might have keyloggers

* General recommendations

- Do setup [[https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html][Veracrypt]] containers for sensitive data
- Do use a password manager such as [[https://keepassxc.org/][KeypassXC ]](store DBs inside veracrypt containers). I usually pick KeypassXC over [[https://bitwarden.com/][Bitwarden]] in a corporate setting unless hosted on-prem...
- Split your browsers accordingly to your internet vs strictly corporate usage:
  - Firefox for safe *general* internet browsing with couple of [[https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#addons][known privacy addons]] (never save passwords among other basics): tutorials, stackoverflow, google searches if you must use Google, etc.
  - IE & Chrome for general corporate websites and apps (ActiveX issues, some security plugins could break applications that you care about).
- Use your [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network][Corporate VPN]] at all time (whenever possible), especially when working from home
- Corporate equipment isn't your personal property:
  - What if my employer can obtain my personal passwords?
  - What if my employer can continuously collect screenshots of my computer activity (personal direct messages, Facebook, Gmail/Hotmail emails, etc.)?
  - What if all my internet traffic is continuously analyzed for security and other purposes?
  - What if SSL traffic can be intercepted via some kind of corporate proxy first?
- If for any reason you need to forward sensitive data over 'free' email services, encrypt the contents with a combination of tools (PGP, OpenSSL, etc.): send yourself invoice copies, timesheets or similar **non-corporate/client** data
