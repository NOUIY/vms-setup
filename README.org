#+TITLE: Virtual Machines Configuration

PLEASE DO NOT USE, THIS IS BROKEN AND UNDER REWRITE...

Things will be broken here and there for a while until I get time.

* What is this?

This is a set of [[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html][ansible playbooks]] for system post-installation configuration, /primarly/ for use within virtual machines ([[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html][VMWare]], [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/][Hyper-V]], [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][VirtualBox]], etc.).
- The goal *IS NOT* a /newbie-friendly/ environment. The only objective is a small system that is reasonably fast with low resources usage (CPU, RAM, etc.).
- Not every virtual machine *requires* a graphical environment (backup server, penetration testing, media server, etc.). If you use *several* *dedicated* virtual machines (i.e. "a la" [[https://www.qubes-os.org/intro/][Qubes OS]]), not installing a UI saves resources. The default shell is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell][Ksh]], the [[https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1][OpenBSD flavor]].

  The screenshot below shows 5 Linux virtual machines (QEMU), running on a MacOS host (iMac Pro).

* What is required?

- Several Linux distributions are used. BSD systems serve mostly as build machines at this time ([[https://www.openbsd.org/][OpenBSD]], [[https://netbsd.org/][NetBSD]], [[https://www.freebsd.org/][FreeBSD]]).
- Package dependencies (the package names might vary from any any BSD or Linux variant to another):
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)][ansible]]: In order to run the provided ansible playbooks.
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git][git]]: To pull additional repositories (/including this one/) from revision control.

* How do I use this?

Please run the following commands in a terminal.

** Clone this repository

#+begin_src sh
   git clone https://github.com/yveszoundi/vms-setup.git
   cd vms-setup
#+end_src

** Apply configurations

There are multiple "formulas" (i.e. YAML files at the root of this project)

#+begin_src sh
 ansible-playbook -K -v -i inventory.ini --become-method=su ossdevservers.yml
#+end_src
