#+TITLE: Windows machine config

* About

This is a set of basic configuration files and scripts towards a basic safe dev environment when I must use Windows:
- I'd still go through a similar process under Mac OS or Linux.
- I have tailored it to my basic needs, it doesn't necessarily reflect what I'm currently using.

* General recommendations

- Do setup [[https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html][Veracrypt]] containers or similar for storing sensitive data
- Do use a password manager such as [[https://keepassxc.org/][KeypassXC ]](store DBs inside veracrypt containers). I usually pick KeypassXC over [[https://bitwarden.com/][Bitwarden]] in a corporate setting unless hosted on-prem...
- Split your browsers accordingly to your internet vs strictly corporate usage (Firefox with [[https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#addons][known privacy addons]] vs IE/Chrome for Intranet or *Trusted websites*)
- Use your [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network][Corporate VPN]] at all time (whenever possible), especially when working from home
- Restrict as much as possible corporate equipment to corporate activities (i.e not for Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, etc.)
- Encrypt data that you *absolutely* need to send to yourself via a combination of tools (PGP, OpenSSL, etc.), emails may not be a good option
