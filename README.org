#+TITLE: Virtual Machines Configuration

* What is this?

A set of scripts and files for Linux environment configuration, /primarly/ within virtual machines ([[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html][VMWare]], [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/][Hyper-V]], [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][VirtualBox]], etc.).

* What is required?

- Supported Linux distros: Only [[https://voidlinux.org/][Void Linux]] is supported at this time now.
  - Q: Why /Void Linux/ first?
  - A: Because it's a distro that I never had time to try
- Package dependencies (the name might vary accordingly to the distribution):
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)][ansible]]: In order to run the provided ansible playbooks.
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git][git]]: Unless you intend to manually download a zip archive of this repository.

* How do I use this?

Please run the following commands in a terminal.

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/yveszoundi/vms-setup.git && cd vms-setup
  ansible-playbook -v void_linux_playbook.yml -K
#+end_src

 Once you're done with the above, finish the configuration:
 - Open a terminal from the console (i.e. =ctrl-alt-f2=).
 - Login with the username =vip= and the password =vip123=
 - Please update your password when prompted
 - Logout using the =exit= command
 - Go to the XDM display manager window (i.e. =ctrl-alt-f1=)
 - Authenticate and you'll notice that you're inside the dwm window manager
 - Type =ctrl-t-k= to close =xconsole=
 - You can read more about the relevant [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/dwm-customization][dwm customizations on Github]]
